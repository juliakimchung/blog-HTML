		<h2>Swimming Improves Muscle Definition and Strength</h2>

		  	<p>Swimmers gain muscle strength throughout the entire body. Where runners see muscle build in their legs, swimmers utilize more muscle groups to move through the water. While the legs kick, the arms pull. As the back reaches and rotates, the stomach tightens to power the legs and stabilize the core, making swimming one of the best aerobic exercises to give you a total body workout. Just look at Michel Phelps’ fit physique if you need inspiration!</p>

		<h2>Swimming Builds Up Bone Mess</h2>

		  	<p>For years, researchers scoffed at the idea that swimming affected bone mass. After all, only weight-bearing exercises were able to achieve this benefit, right? Not according to <a href="http://www3.scienceblog.com/community/older/2003/C/2003924.html">research</a> published in the Journal of Applied Physiology. Because there are ethical reasons to avoid in-depth bone examination on humans, the study put rats into three groups: running, swimming, and a control group with no exercise stimulation. While running still showed the highest increase in BMD (Bone Mineral Density), the swimming group also showed benefits over the control group in both BMD and femoral bone weight. While more studies are needed, these new findings show that previous research dismissing swimming’s bone benefits may need to be revisited.</p>

		 <h2>Swimming Lowers Stress and Depression</h2>

	      	<p>Explored the relationship between swimming and the reduction of psychological stress. 22 male and 14 female college students were randomly assigned to a swimming or record-keeping activity in the pool area. The stress-reducing influences of class atmosphere, student interaction, and time away from the classroom were identical in both swimming and the control activity of keeping records. Inclusion of a lecture-control class of 38 undergraduates provided information about possible seasonal and testing effects. Participants completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Profile of Mood States before and after each activity. Women reported less anxiety after class regardless of whether they swam or kept records. Men reported no changes in anxiety. Swimmers reported short-term increases in fatigue. Fatigue from high-intensity exercise might have negated the psychological benefits.</p>

	     <h2>Swimming Can Make You Smarter</h2>

	     	<p>Of course all exercise is great for the mind, but can swimming actually make you smarter? Research from Australia focused on kids who took swimming lessons compared to a control group of non-swimmers. The results showed that kids who regularly participated in swimming were able to master language development, fine motor skills, confidence, and physical development sooner than the control group. Swimming may also help with math skills, as swimmers regularly calculate the meters swum in sets or interval drills to put their adding and subtraction skills to work.</p>

	     <h2>Swimming May Just Lengthen Your Life</h2>

	     	<p>While all exercise can produce greater health and longevity, studies point to swimming as one of the best choices for doing so. Researchers at the University of South Carolina looked at 40,547 men, aged 20 to 90, for over 32 years. The results showed that those who swam had a 50 percent lower death rate than runners, walkers, or men who didn’t exercise.

		  	<h3>What Muscles Does Swimming Exercise?</h3>
		  		<p>
		  			Upper Body

                All types of swimming strokes work the chest, but the breaststroke specifically targets this area, especially the pectoral chest muscles. The breaststroke also helps hone the trapezius muscles of the back, which extend from the neck to the mid-back region. Swimming using the front crawl stroke, commonly known as freestyle form, serves as an excellent upper-body workout, as it hits arm muscles including the deltoids, triceps and biceps. The front crawl also works the shoulder area, including the latissimus dorsi -- which runs from the underarm down the side of the back -- and trapezius muscles.

                Core

                Because swimmers must work to balance themselves in the water, swimming tones and strengthens the core abdominal muscles. This calorie-burning exercise also melts away up to 100 calories every 10 minutes, making abs more sculpted and visible. The backstroke and butterfly in particular help tone the stomach muscles.

                Lower Body

                The front crawl's flutter kick exercises and strengthens many leg muscles, including the upper leg quadriceps and hamstrings and the gluteal muscles of the buttock and thigh. In the lower-leg area, this type of stroke benefits the calves. The breaststroke works these muscle groups as well, but its particular type of kick -- the whip kick -- demands more from the thigh's adductor and abductor muscles. Backstroke swimming helps stretch the hip flexors.

                Other Benefits

                More of swimming's broad benefits range from decreased anxiety to weight loss to better bone health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note that water-based exercise helps ease joints affected by arthritis and osteoarthritis. As a cardiovascular exercise, it has the potential to improve overall endurance as it helps strengthen the heart and trains the body to maximize the use of oxygen intake and lung function. This low-impact exercise also accommodates those with limited mobility and may improve posture and flexibility.

				<h3>Here’s the gist, excerpted from the article “Staying Happy?” <a href="http://www.usmsswimmer.com/issue.php?i=31">by Jim Thornton in the Jan/Feb issue of “Swimmer” magazine.</a></h3>

				<p>Regardless of cause, a growing number of researchers and psychologists alike have become true believers in the efficacy of swimming. “We know, for instance, that vigorous exercise like swimming can significantly decrease both anxiety and depression” says sports psychologist Aimee C. Kimball, director of mental training at the Center for Sports Medicine at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “Currently, there’s a ton of research looking at the various mechanisms by which it works.”

				On the physiological level, hard swimming workouts release endorphins, natural feel-good compounds whose very name derives from “endogenous” and “morphine.” Swimming serves, as well, to sop us excess fight-or-flight stress hormones, converting free-floating angst into muscle relaxation. It can even promote so-called “hippocampal neurogenesis” – the growth of new brain cells in a part of the brain that atrophies under chronic stress. In animal models, exercise has shown itself to be even more potent than drugs like Prozac at spurring such beneficial changes.

				Moby Coquillard, a psychotherapist and swimmer from San Mateo, Calif., is so convinced that he prescribes exercise to depressed patients. “I absolutely believe swimming can serve as a kind of medicine. For me, it represents a potent adjunct to antidepressant medications and, for some patients, it’s something you can take in lieu of pills.”

				Besides possible biochemical changes in the brain, swimming requires 	the alternating stretch and relaxation of skeletal muscles while simultaneously deep-breathing in a rhythmic pattern. If this sounds familiar, it’s because these are key elements of many practices, from hatha yoga to progressive muscle relaxation, used to evoke the relaxation response. “Swimming, because of its repetitive nature, is incredibly meditative,” Coquillard says. There’s even a built-in mantra, be this the slow count of laps, or self-directed thoughts like “relax” or “stay smooth.”

				“I teach a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy class for depression,” he adds, “and we use focus on the body here in the moment to keep past thoughts or future worries from invading our consciousness.” By concentrating on different aspects of their stroke mechanics, from hip rotation and kick patterns, to streamlining and pulls, regular swimmers practice this intuitively. The result: On a regular basis, most get a break from life’s not always pleasant stream of rumination.

				Moreover, since most pools have set times for lap swimming and coached Masters workouts alike, regular swimmer usually find themselves settling into a schedule that becomes automatic. There’s no need to decide if you should go exercise now or later. For stressed out people, this lack of options, says Coquillard, is paradoxically comforting because it removes the burden of yet another decision. “All you have to do is show up at the regular time,” he says, “and you know there’s a good chance you’ll end up leaving the pool feeling a little better than when you arrived.</p>
